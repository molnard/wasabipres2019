Fungibility!
Sound familiar but what does it mean exactly?
Fungibility is a principle in economics it says a token of value such a currency coin is indistinguishable of any other coins. Either you can’t say I would accept US dollars but only if their serial number is odd, if it is even that is evil money I won't touch it. If you say that you are breaking the law. The law requires you to threat equally and the government can't say that either. So that creates fungibility. Every dollat billet is fully exchangable of any other dollat billet for equal. That principal is fundamental to currency.

If you visit the bitcoin.mit.edu website you will see the following statement. If there is no fungibility that statement would not be correct.
If you destroy fungibility you destroy the means of exchange function of the currency. For example, in bitcoin you can create a blacklist or a whitelist. What it does that it imposes a burden on everyone. If you receive money now, you don’t know if it is real unless you also check that against the latest version of the blacklist to see if it not one of the banned ones. You can’t do that, that does not scale. If there was a mass centralization in mining to adopt that kind of policy that would be a destructive event for bitcoin.

Is that really what me and you concerned about today? Fungibility? In my opinion is no! Of course in the long term I care about that but for today I would like to use my bitcoins.
