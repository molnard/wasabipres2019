# Fungibility!
Sound familiar but what does it mean exactly?
Fungibility is a principle in economics it says a token of value such a currency coin is indistinguishable of any other coins. Either you can’t say I would accept US dollars but only if their serial number is odd, if it is even that is evil money I won't touch it. If you say that you are breaking the law. The law requires you to threat equally and the government can't say that either. So that creates fungibility. Every dollat billet is fully exchangable of any other dollat billet for equal. That principal is fundamental to currency.

If you visit the bitcoin.mit.edu website you will see the following statement. If there is no fungibility that statement would not be correct.
If you destroy fungibility you destroy the means of exchange function of the currency. For example, in bitcoin you can create a blacklist or a whitelist. What it does that it imposes a burden on everyone. If you receive money now, you don’t know if it is real unless you also check that against the latest version of the blacklist to see if it not one of the banned ones. You can’t do that, that does not scale. If there was a mass centralization in mining to adopt that kind of policy that would be a destructive event for bitcoin.

Is that really what we concerned about today? Do you I care with fungibility? In my opinion is not really! (Of course in the long term I care about that) BUT for today I would like to use my bitcoins without any restriction. 
Bitcoin is often described as an anonymous cryptocurrency, but this is incorrect. Bitcoin is actually pseudonymous. The distinction is crucial: under a cryptographic pseudonym, your behavior can still be tracked.

How is this done? It starts with the fiat onramps, where an exchange collects information on you through their KYC process. This information that is often shared with other exchanges when investigating suspicious activity. Even once take your Bitcoin onto the mainnet, your activity can still be tracked. Heuristics and clustering analysis are often used to identify exchanges, mixers, and other common blockchain services you use. Supernodes connect to large swathes of the Bitcoin network and correlate transactions with their originating IPs. Even with meticulous opsec and address rotation (which most people don’t do), if you ever want to turn your Bitcoin back into fiat, that offramp is just as highly regulated. Often you will be turned away if your Bitcoin appears tainted by signs of illegal activity.

This is more than hypothetical. Exchanges have significant insight into the flows of Bitcoin — enough to successfully deter hacks, stolen funds, and regularly file suspicious activity reports (as all US exchanges are required to). Companies like Chainalysis provide surveillance services to law enforcement and various three-letter agencies, reportedly earning more than $5.7M in 2018 via government contracts.

Still not care about this? You are doing nothing illegal, no darknet connection, you are clean like the brand new snow.
# Story
In the oldern days I sold bitcoins face to face. The buyer bought it and just for fun I decided to follow my coins just to see where it will land. One day I found that the final buyer has 32 BTC and sent that to BITMEX. That a lot of money.
Every buy or sell you will compromise one of your addresses.

When you are sending money, are you ready to share every transaction connected to it in the past?
When you are receiving money, are you ready to share every transaction connected to it in the future? 
Even if you are doing nothing illegal (as most of the bitcoin users) that sound terrifying at least for me. 
Do we need fungibility? Yes but we need more. WE NEED Privacy!
