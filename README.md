_Odd dollar example_
# Fungibility!
Sound familiar but what does it mean exactly?
Fungibility is a principle in economics it says a token of value such a currency coin is indistinguishable of any other coins. Either you can’t say I would accept US dollars but only if their serial number is odd, if it is even that is evil money I won't touch it. If you say that you are breaking the law. The law requires you to threat equally and the government can't say that either. So that creates fungibility. Every dollat billet is fully exchangable of any other dollat billet for equal. That principal is fundamental to currency.

If you visit the bitcoin.mit.edu website you will see the following statement. If there is no fungibility that statement would not be correct.

_Consequence_
If you destroy fungibility you destroy the means of exchange function of the currency. For example, in bitcoin you can create a blacklist or a whitelist. __What it does that it imposes a burden on everyone.__ If you receive money now, you don’t know if it is real unless you also check that against the latest version of the blacklist to see if it not one of the banned ones. You can’t do that, that does not scale. If there was a mass centralization in mining to adopt that kind of policy that would be a destructive event for bitcoin.

_Personal implications_
Bitcoin is often described as an anonymous cryptocurrency, but this is incorrect. Bitcoin is actually pseudonymous(no p in the beginning). The distinction is crucial: under a cryptographic pseudonym, your behavior can still be tracked. KYC exchanges collect personal information which is shared with other exchanges, Heuristics and clustering analysis to identify exchanges, mixers, supernodes connect to large swathes and correlate transaction with their originating IPs.
Companies like Chainalysis provide surveillance services to law enforcement and various three-letter agencies, reportedly earning more than about 6M dollar in 2018 via government contracts.

Is that really what we concerned about today? Do you care with fungibility? In my opinion: not really! (Of course in the long term I care) BUT for today I would like to use my bitcoins without any restrictions. You are doing nothing illegal, no darknet connections, you are clean like the brand new snow. 

When you are sending money, are you ready to share every transactions connected to it in the past?
When you are receiving money, are you ready to share every transactions connected to it in the future? 
Even if you are doing nothing illegal (as most of the bitcoin users) __even so__ I do not feel comfortable to share that information.
__Do we need fungibility? Yes but we need more. WE NEED Privacy!__
 
_Story: traceing a coin_
In the oldern days I sold bitcoins face to face. The buyer bought it and just for fun I decided to follow my coins just to see where it will land. One day I found that the final buyer has 32 BTC and sent that to BITMEX. That a lot of money.
Every buy or sell you will compromise one of your addresses.

# Privacy
What can we do to keep our privacy? There is a lot to do

_Story: centralized mixers_
In the past, traditional bitcoin mixers provide centralized way to obfuscate the ledger. The problem is that you have to send your coins into the mixer and they will send back the mixed bitcoin for you. For example: Bitcoin fog worked for years without an issue had a good feedback but later it became a selective scam. You send the money it mixes but if you are sending a larger amount then it will take it from you. Tricky isn't it? We have to take special care 

_Decentralized mixers_
Just to mention without going into the datails 
Thumblebit is a unidirectional payment hub something like lightning network but without the network part and it is anonymus. Joinmarket is instant Thumblebit can archive higher anonimity set. 

The CoinJoin Transaction

# Anonymity network

We need TOR. No TOR library for dotnet 

# Network analysis

There is no light wallet that would not fail on the privacy level against network analysis. Every light wallet is volnurable to network analysis. With most light wallet is easy to see because it is mostly just querying a web API so every bitcoin address are exposed and just connected together.

_story_
Jonas Nick has deaninimyzed a lot of SPV wallets he said that give me one of your bitcoin address and I give back 70 percent of your wallett addresses. That is pretty scary.

_SPV filtering_
BIP158 new proposal which is in the process of getting finalized. It is apparently in discussion. The way how it works you download filters you do not tell the nodes what to filter and than you can figure out what block are relevant to my use case to my wallet. 

You have a constant set of filters you get if from some source and from thoose filters you can figure out which block you are interested in and you get the blocks from random nodes. So basically no on can figure out which transactions you are interested in. Even the blocks because you are using Tor and changing Tor circuits it is just really hard if not impossible. So this is the first light wallet architecture thats truly light wallet architecture that does not ruin your privacy. Because bitcoin core nodes does not support it yet so we have our backend that sends the filters to the clients and thats how it works. 

You can run a fullnode too and configure Wasabi to use that.
